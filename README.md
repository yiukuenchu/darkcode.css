# Description
This is a showcase of some **CSS tricks** and **Web UI design** I learnt from Youtube channel [DarkCode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD3KVjbb7aq2OiOffuungzw).

I consider it a milestone which records the progress I've made in DarkCode courses so far as well.
  
# Purpose
I created this showcase for self-learning and to share these beautiful codes!

# Other
This is a repository of **FOCUS, MAGIC & LOVE**! 

Hooray! üç∫
